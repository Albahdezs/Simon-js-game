# Simon-js-game

¡Hi everyone! :hand:

✨ Welcome to my first repository on GitHub. ✨

I've tried to showcase all the new skills I learned with Conquer Blocks. I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed programming it.

 Simon Game is a memory-based game where the player has to repeat a sequence of colors generated by the game. The sequence starts with one color, and each time the player successfully repeats it, the game adds another color to the sequence. The player must remember and repeat the entire sequence in the correct order. If the player makes a mistake, the game ends, and the player's longest streak of correct colors is displayed as their score. Players can also choose to finish the game at any time, and the streak is shown at the end.
